							DietRx provides a platform for exploring health impacts of dietary ingredients by integrating interrelationships among food
							and key molecular agents. The resource assimilates dietary factors (food and chemicals), their health consequences
							(diseases) and genetic mechanisms to facilitate queries for investigating associations among these entities. At the
							core of the DietRx is the 280328 positive/negative food-disease associations for 2337 food entities belonging to 25
							categories (plant, fruit, meat, etc.) text-mined from biomedical literature (27 million MEDLINE abstracts) using a
							state-of-the-art deep learning based relation extraction model (Precision=0.87, Recall=0.8 and F1 Score = 0.84). These
							data are further interlinked with those involving food chemicals and genes compiled from curated data sources. Thus,
							DietRx is a seamless exploration platform for probing elements central to diet and their health consequences. DietRx
							facilitates study of associations among food, disease, chemicals and genes to enable drawing data-driven inferences
							to be used for culinary interventions as well as for drug discovery.

							The second tab provides details of chemicals reported to be associated with the disease term (compiled from CTD) and those

							Disease-Chemical interactions by virtue of a chemical that reported to be associated with a gene which is further
							linked to the disease are marked as ‘Inferred’. Clicking on the ‘DETAILS’ tab provides the details of genes through
							which the disease-gene link was speculated.
						</p>
						<p>
 For example, Cis-Resveratrol(PubChem CID '1548910') is inferred to be associated with Cardio Vascular Diseases(MeSH Disease
ID 'D002318') via 27 gene associations.Also, CTD provides a direct therapeutic association. Clicking on the 'DETAILS' button
provides PubChem ID, Common Name, Functional Group, and Source details.

 For Example, caspase 3(Entrez Gene ID '836';Official Gene Symbol;'CASP3') is inferred to be linked with Cardio Vascular
Diseases(MeSH Disease ID 'D002318') via 31 chemical associations. These inferences are drawn using Disease-Chemical (CTD)
and Chemical-Gene associations (CTD).

							The Gene-Food associations were inferred via diseases and chemicals. The former refers to putative food associations for
							a gene by virtue of the food being linked with the disease term (DietRx text mining) which is further linked to the
							gene (DisGeNET). The latter refers to putative food associations for a gene due the food having a chemical (KNApSAcK,
							Phenol Explorer, Foodb, USDA and DUKE) which itself is linked to the disease (CTD). For every food entity, the table
							provides details of ‘NCBI Taxonomy ID’, ‘Food Name’, and ‘Food Category’. The ‘Via Diseases’ and ‘Via Chemicals’ column
							indicate the number of MeSH disease terms and food chemicals through which the association was inferred. Clicking
							on the ‘DETAILS’ button presents a pop up window with details of these chemicals (PubChem ID, Common Name and Functional
							Group) as well as disease terms (MeSH Disease ID, Disease Name, Disease Category).

						</p>

							A gene may have been reported to linked a disease term from empirical evidence. Or an association may be inferred via Gene-Chemical
							(CTD) and Chemical-Disease links (CTD). Both of these association types are presented along with details of details

						</p>
						<p>
							For example, Inflammation Disease term(MeSH Disease ID 'D007249';Category'Pathology(process)') is linked to 'TNF receptor superfamily member 1A' via 18 Gene-Chemical (CTD) and Chemical-Disease links (CTD) inferences.
